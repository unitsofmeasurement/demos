=== Example Code
Now you are ready to run a first "Hello World" project.

. We called it +HelloEdison+ in the package +tech.uom.demo.edison.hello+
. The following code: 
+
[source,java]
----
        System.out.println("Hello Edison.");
        System.out.println("How about a little lightbulb efficiency calculation?;-)");
        final MessageFormat question = new MessageFormat(
                "What is the power consumption of a lamp that has luminous flux of {0} and luminous efficacy of {1} lumens per watt (lm/W)?");
        final MessageFormat answer = new MessageFormat("You need a {0} lightbulb.");
        
        Quantity<LuminousFlux> luminousFlux = Quantities.getQuantity(900, SI.LUMEN);
        final Unit<LuminousEfficacy> LM_PER_WATT = SI.LUMEN.divide(SI.WATT).asType(LuminousEfficacy.class);
        final Number LF_VALUE = 15;
        final Object[] questionArgs = {luminousFlux, LF_VALUE};
        System.out.println(question.format(questionArgs));
        Quantity<LuminousEfficacy>  luminousEfficacy = Quantities.getQuantity(LM_VALUE, LM_PER_WATT);
        Quantity<Power> p = luminousFlux.divide(luminousEfficacy).asType(Power.class);
        final Object[] answerArgs = {p};
        System.out.println(answer.format(answerArgs));
----
+
Calculates which light bulb is required in order to produce a certain "brightness".
+

Based on the formula:

+P = LF/LE+

Where:

 * +P+ is Power in Watt
 * +LF+ is Luminous Flux in lumen
 * +LE+ is LuminousEfficacy in lumen per Watt

Our example API will provide methods for computing any of the above, given the other two.

Here's how it looks running on Edison
